# Yellow SDK Removal Complete

## Summary
Successfully completed the removal of Yellow SDK integration from the Sonic Wave Player application. All Yellow SDK related files, services, and components have been removed.

## Files Removed

### Services
- `src/services/yellowSDKService.ts` - Main Yellow SDK service
- `src/services/nitroLiteService.ts` - Nitro Lite payment channel service

### Components  
- `src/components/YellowSDKStatusIndicator.tsx` - Status indicator component
- `src/components/UnifiedWalletStatus.tsx` - Unified wallet status component

### Providers & Hooks
- `src/providers/YellowProvider.tsx` - Yellow SDK React context provider
- `src/hooks/useYellowSDK.ts` - Yellow SDK React hook

### Tests
- `src/services/__tests__/yellowSDKIntegration.test.ts` - Integration tests

## Configuration Changes
- Removed `YELLOW_SDK_CONFIG` from `src/config/environment.ts`
- Removed all Yellow SDK related environment variables

## Verification
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes with no errors
- ✅ No remaining references to deleted files
- ✅ No unused imports or dependencies

## Impact
The application now operates without Yellow SDK integration. All payment and wallet functionality should use the existing Web3 service and other payment providers as needed.

## Next Steps
If payment channel functionality is needed in the future, consider:
1. Implementing a different payment channel solution
2. Using Layer 2 solutions like Polygon or Arbitrum
3. Integrating with other payment providers
