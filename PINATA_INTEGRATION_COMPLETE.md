# Pinata IPFS Integration Complete üéµ

## Overview

Successfully integrated Pinata IPFS storage with the Sonic Wave music platform. Users can now access all music files uploaded to Pinata through the main webapp interface, with proper album grouping and artwork display.

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Pinata Library Service** (`src/services/pinataLibraryService.ts`)
- **Gateway Integration**: Uses `silver-changing-rook-174.mypinata.cloud` as the primary gateway
- **File Discovery**: Fetches files from Pinata API or uses gateway discovery
- **Metadata Extraction**: Parses filenames and metadata to extract track information
- **Album Grouping**: Groups tracks by album name from metadata or filename patterns
- **Artwork Matching**: Automatically finds and associates artwork with albums
- **Caching**: Implements localStorage caching for performance

### 2. **Enhanced Music Service** (`src/services/musicService.ts`)
- **Pinata Integration**: Pinata tracks appear first in all music lists
- **Unified Search**: Search includes Pinata tracks with proper filtering
- **Album/Artist Management**: Creates albums and artists from Pinata tracks
- **Refresh Capability**: Can refresh Pinata library on demand

### 3. **Updated Home Page** (`src/pages/Home.tsx`)
- **Pinata Section**: Dedicated "Your Music Library" section for Pinata tracks
- **Visual Indicators**: Green badges showing "Pinata IPFS" source
- **Track Count**: Shows number of Pinata tracks available
- **Prominent Display**: Pinata tracks appear before other content

### 4. **Enhanced Library Page** (`src/pages/Library.tsx`)
- **Tabbed Interface**: Separate tabs for "All Music", "Pinata IPFS", and "Your Uploads"
- **Gateway Info**: Shows the Pinata gateway URL being used
- **Refresh Button**: Manual refresh capability for Pinata library
- **Statistics**: Shows track counts for each source
- **Loading States**: Proper loading and error handling

## üéØ Key Features

### **Automatic File Processing**
- Supports multiple audio formats (MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC, OGG)
- Extracts metadata from filenames using common patterns:
  - `Artist - Album - Track.ext`
  - `Artist - Track.ext`
  - `Album/Track.ext`
- Automatically finds artwork files for albums

### **Album Compilation**
- Groups tracks with the same album name together
- Finds corresponding artwork files automatically
- Creates proper album objects with track listings
- Supports various naming conventions

### **Gateway Optimization**
- Uses your specific Pinata gateway: `silver-changing-rook-174.mypinata.cloud`
- Fallback to other IPFS gateways if needed
- Caches gateway responses for performance

### **User Experience**
- Pinata tracks appear prominently in the interface
- Clear visual indicators showing IPFS source
- Seamless integration with existing player
- No separate "demo" page needed

## üîß Configuration

### **Environment Variables**
The system uses these environment variables (already configured):
```env
VITE_PINATA_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_PINATA_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
VITE_PINATA_JWT=your_jwt_token
```

### **Gateway Configuration**
- Primary Gateway: `silver-changing-rook-174.mypinata.cloud`
- Automatic fallback to public IPFS gateways
- Configurable in `pinataLibraryService.ts`

## üìÅ File Organization Expected

For best results, organize your Pinata uploads like this:

### **Audio Files**
```
Artist - Album - Track Name.mp3
Artist - Album - Another Track.mp3
```

### **Artwork Files**
```
Album Name Cover.jpg
Album Name Artwork.png
cover.jpg (generic)
artwork.png (generic)
```

### **Metadata (Optional)**
Use Pinata metadata keyvalues:
- `title`: Track title
- `artist`: Artist name
- `album`: Album name
- `genre`: Music genre
- `year`: Release year

## üéµ How It Works

1. **File Discovery**: Service queries Pinata API for all pinned files
2. **Audio Filtering**: Filters for audio file types
3. **Metadata Extraction**: Parses filenames and Pinata metadata
4. **Album Grouping**: Groups tracks by album name
5. **Artwork Matching**: Finds corresponding artwork files
6. **Track Creation**: Creates Track objects compatible with the player
7. **Integration**: Adds tracks to main music library with IPFS metadata

## üöÄ Usage

### **For Users**
1. Upload music files to your Pinata account
2. Use consistent naming: `Artist - Album - Track.ext`
3. Upload artwork with album names in filename
4. Files automatically appear in Sonic Wave webapp
5. Use the refresh button to update the library

### **For Developers**
```typescript
// Get all Pinata tracks
const tracks = await pinataLibraryService.getAllTracks();

// Search Pinata tracks
const results = await pinataLibraryService.searchTracks("query");

// Refresh library
await musicService.refreshPinataLibrary();
```
