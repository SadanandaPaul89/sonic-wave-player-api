# Design Document

## Overview

The frontend revamp will transform the existing React/TypeScript music streaming application to match a new Figma design with animations. The application currently uses a modern tech stack including React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components, and Radix UI primitives. The revamp will maintain this architecture while implementing new visual designs and smooth animations throughout the user interface.

The design approach focuses on:
- Preserving existing functionality while updating visual presentation
- Implementing performant animations using CSS transitions and Framer Motion
- Maintaining responsive design across all device sizes
- Using the existing component architecture and design system
- Ensuring accessibility standards are met with new animations

## Architecture

### Component Architecture
The application will maintain its current component-based architecture with the following enhancements:

**Layout Components:**
- Enhanced `Layout.tsx` with new design styling
- Updated `Sidebar.tsx` with new navigation design and animations
- Improved `Player.tsx` with animated controls and visualizations

**Page Components:**
- All existing pages (Home, Search, Library, etc.) will be restyled to match Figma designs
- New animation wrappers for page transitions
- Enhanced loading states with skeleton animations

**UI Components:**
- Existing shadcn/ui components will be customized with new design tokens
- New animated components for specific interactions
- Enhanced form components with micro-interactions

### Animation Architecture
**Animation Library Selection:**
- Primary: CSS transitions and Tailwind CSS animations for simple interactions
- Secondary: Framer Motion for complex animations and page transitions
- Fallback: CSS keyframes for browser compatibility

**Animation Categories:**
1. **Micro-interactions:** Button hovers, form field focus, loading spinners
2. **Page transitions:** Route changes, modal appearances, drawer slides
3. **Content animations:** List item reveals, card hover effects, scroll-triggered animations
4. **Player animations:** Waveform visualizations, progress bars, control feedback

### State Management
- Maintain existing React Query for server state
- Use React Context for theme and animation preferences
- Local component state for animation triggers and UI interactions

## Components and Interfaces

### Core Component Updates

**Layout Component Interface:**
```typescript
interface LayoutProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  animationPreference?: 'reduced' | 'full';
}
```

**Animation Wrapper Component:**
```typescript
interface AnimationWrapperProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  animation: 'fadeIn' | 'slideUp' | 'slideLeft' | 'scale';
  delay?: number;
  duration?: number;
  trigger?: 'onMount' | 'onScroll' | 'onHover';
}
```

**Enhanced Player Interface:**
```typescript
interface PlayerProps {
  currentTrack: Track | null;
  isPlaying: boolean;
  showVisualizer?: boolean;
  animatedControls?: boolean;
}
```

### New Components

**Page Transition Component:**
- Handles route-based animations
- Configurable transition types
- Loading state management

**Scroll Animation Component:**
- Intersection Observer-based triggers
- Configurable animation thresholds
- Performance optimized

**Loading Skeleton Components:**
- Match new design aesthetic
- Animated placeholders for different content types
- Responsive skeleton layouts

## Data Models

### Animation Configuration
```typescript
interface AnimationConfig {
  reducedMotion: boolean;
  transitionDuration: number;
  easing: string;
  enablePageTransitions: boolean;
  enableMicroInteractions: boolean;
}
```

### Theme Extension
```typescript
interface ExtendedTheme {
  colors: ThemeColors;
  animations: {
    durations: Record<string, string>;
    easings: Record<string, string>;
    keyframes: Record<string, object>;
  };
  spacing: Record<string, string>;
  typography: Record<string, object>;
}
```

## Error Handling

### Animation Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks for unsupported animations
- Performance monitoring for animation-heavy components
- User preference detection for reduced motion
- Error boundaries for animation components

### Design Implementation Error Handling
- Fallback styling for missing design tokens
- Progressive enhancement for advanced CSS features
- Cross-browser compatibility checks
- Responsive design breakpoint validation

## Testing Strategy

### Visual Regression Testing
- Screenshot comparison tests for key components
- Cross-browser visual testing
- Responsive design validation
- Animation state testing

### Performance Testing
- Animation performance profiling
- Bundle size impact assessment
- Runtime performance monitoring
- Memory usage optimization

### Accessibility Testing
- Screen reader compatibility with animations
- Keyboard navigation with new designs
- Color contrast validation
- Motion sensitivity compliance

### Component Testing
- Unit tests for animation logic
- Integration tests for page transitions
- User interaction testing
- State management testing

### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Foundation**
- Update design tokens and CSS variables
- Implement base animation utilities
- Create animation wrapper components
- Set up performance monitoring

**Phase 2: Core Components**
- Revamp Layout and Sidebar components
- Implement page transition system
- Update Player component with animations
- Create loading skeleton components

**Phase 3: Page Implementation**
- Update all page components to match Figma designs
- Implement scroll-triggered animations
- Add micro-interactions to forms and buttons
- Optimize responsive behavior

**Phase 4: Polish and Optimization**
- Performance optimization
- Cross-browser testing and fixes
- Accessibility improvements
- Animation preference controls

### Technical Considerations

**Performance Optimization:**
- Use CSS transforms for animations (GPU acceleration)
- Implement animation frame throttling
- Lazy load animation libraries
- Optimize bundle splitting for animation code

**Browser Compatibility:**
- Fallback animations for older browsers
- Progressive enhancement approach
- CSS feature detection
- Polyfills for unsupported features

**Accessibility:**
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
- Provide animation toggle controls
- Ensure animations don't interfere with screen readers
- Maintain focus management during transitions
