# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves a complete frontend revamp based on a Figma design that includes animations. The goal is to transform the existing React/TypeScript application to match the new design specifications while implementing smooth animations and maintaining functionality. The revamp will modernize the user interface and enhance user experience through thoughtful animations and updated visual design.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a modernized interface that matches the new Figma design, so that I have an improved and visually appealing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the interface SHALL display according to the new Figma design specifications
2. WHEN viewing any page THEN the layout SHALL be responsive and work across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
3. WHEN interacting with UI elements THEN the styling SHALL match the Figma design exactly including colors, typography, spacing, and component styles

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to experience smooth animations throughout the interface, so that the application feels modern and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL display smooth page transitions
2. WHEN interacting with buttons and interactive elements THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate hover and click animations
3. WHEN content loads THEN the system SHALL show smooth loading animations and state transitions
4. WHEN scrolling through content THEN the system SHALL display scroll-triggered animations where specified in the design

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to maintain all existing functionality while displaying the new design, so that I don't lose any features during the revamp.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using any existing feature THEN the system SHALL maintain the same functionality as before the revamp
2. WHEN data is loaded or submitted THEN the system SHALL continue to work with existing APIs and data structures
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display error states according to the new design while maintaining proper error handling

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the new frontend to be maintainable and follow best practices, so that future updates and modifications are straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing components THEN the system SHALL use reusable component patterns
2. WHEN adding animations THEN the system SHALL use performant animation libraries and techniques
3. WHEN structuring code THEN the system SHALL maintain clean separation of concerns and follow existing project patterns
4. WHEN implementing responsive design THEN the system SHALL use consistent breakpoints and design tokens
