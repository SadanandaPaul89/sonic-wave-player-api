# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on comprehensive testing of the Pinata API integration for audio storage in our music platform. The goal is to validate that our Pinata IPFS implementation works reliably for uploading, storing, retrieving, and managing audio files, ensuring optimal performance and error handling for our decentralized music storage system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test Pinata API authentication and connectivity, so that I can ensure our API credentials are valid and the service is accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL validate Pinata API credentials using the test endpoint
2. WHEN API credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message indicating authentication failure
3. WHEN the Pinata service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle the connection timeout gracefully
4. WHEN API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry logic with exponential backoff

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test audio file uploads to Pinata, so that I can verify that various audio formats are properly stored on IPFS.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading an MP3 file THEN the system SHALL successfully store it on Pinata and return a valid IPFS hash
2. WHEN uploading a WAV file THEN the system SHALL process and store it with proper metadata
3. WHEN uploading a FLAC file THEN the system SHALL handle the lossless format correctly
4. WHEN uploading files larger than 50MB THEN the system SHALL handle large file uploads without timeout
5. WHEN uploading unsupported file formats THEN the system SHALL reject the upload with appropriate error messages
6. WHEN upload progress is tracked THEN the system SHALL provide accurate progress updates throughout the process

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test file retrieval from Pinata, so that I can ensure uploaded audio files are accessible and playable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN retrieving a file by IPFS hash THEN the system SHALL return the correct file content
2. WHEN accessing files through Pinata gateway THEN the system SHALL provide fast and reliable access
3. WHEN files are not found THEN the system SHALL return appropriate 404 errors
4. WHEN gateway is slow or unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to alternative IPFS gateways
5. WHEN streaming audio files THEN the system SHALL support HTTP range requests for efficient playback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test Pinata pinning operations, so that I can ensure uploaded files remain permanently available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pinning a file THEN the system SHALL successfully pin it to Pinata's IPFS nodes
2. WHEN unpinning a file THEN the system SHALL remove it from Pinata's pinning service
3. WHEN listing pinned files THEN the system SHALL retrieve accurate metadata about stored files
4. WHEN checking pin status THEN the system SHALL verify if a file is currently pinned
5. WHEN pinning fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test metadata handling with Pinata, so that I can ensure audio file information is properly stored and retrieved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading files with metadata THEN the system SHALL store custom metadata alongside the file
2. WHEN retrieving file information THEN the system SHALL return complete metadata including upload date and file properties
3. WHEN updating metadata THEN the system SHALL allow modification of existing file metadata
4. WHEN searching by metadata THEN the system SHALL support filtering files by custom properties

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test error handling and edge cases, so that I can ensure the system behaves predictably under various failure conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL queue uploads for retry when connection is restored
2. WHEN API quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about usage limits
3. WHEN duplicate files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL detect and handle duplicates appropriately
4. WHEN corrupted files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate file integrity and reject invalid files
5. WHEN concurrent uploads occur THEN the system SHALL handle multiple simultaneous operations without conflicts

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test performance characteristics, so that I can optimize the audio storage system for production use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN measuring upload speeds THEN the system SHALL track and report upload performance metrics
2. WHEN testing with various file sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent performance across different file sizes
3. WHEN monitoring gateway response times THEN the system SHALL measure and compare different IPFS gateway performance
4. WHEN testing under load THEN the system SHALL handle multiple concurrent operations efficiently
5. WHEN caching is enabled THEN the system SHALL demonstrate improved performance for repeated operations
