# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current IPFS audio system has critical playback issues where uploaded audio files cannot be played back properly. Users can upload audio files to the IPFS system, but when they attempt to play these files, they encounter errors or silence. The system generates mock IPFS hashes and loses track of the actual audio data, making the stored files unplayable. This feature will fix the audio playback mechanism to ensure that IPFS-stored audio files can be reliably played back.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user who has uploaded audio files to IPFS, I want to be able to play back my uploaded files reliably, so that I can listen to my music collection stored on the decentralized network.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an audio file to IPFS THEN the system SHALL store the actual audio data in a way that can be retrieved for playback
2. WHEN a user clicks play on an IPFS-stored audio file THEN the system SHALL successfully load and play the audio without errors
3. WHEN the system generates an IPFS hash for uploaded content THEN it SHALL maintain a reliable mapping between the hash and the playable audio data
4. WHEN a user refreshes the page or returns later THEN previously uploaded IPFS audio files SHALL still be playable

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the IPFS audio player to handle different audio formats and qualities gracefully, so that I can enjoy optimal playback regardless of my network conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system stores audio files THEN it SHALL preserve the original audio format and quality for playback
2. WHEN network conditions are detected THEN the system SHALL attempt to serve the most appropriate quality version available
3. IF a specific quality version is not available THEN the system SHALL fallback to the original uploaded file
4. WHEN audio playback fails with one method THEN the system SHALL attempt alternative playback strategies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error handling and debugging information for IPFS audio issues, so that I can quickly identify and resolve playback problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio playback fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages indicating the cause
2. WHEN IPFS content cannot be retrieved THEN the system SHALL log detailed information about the failure
3. WHEN blob URLs become invalid THEN the system SHALL detect this and attempt to regenerate them
4. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logging of the audio loading and playback process

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want uploaded audio files to persist across browser sessions, so that my IPFS music library remains accessible over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads audio files THEN the system SHALL store them in a way that survives browser restarts
2. WHEN localStorage becomes full or unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle storage limitations
3. WHEN the system starts up THEN it SHALL restore access to previously uploaded audio files
4. WHEN storage cleanup is needed THEN the system SHALL provide options to manage cached audio files

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the IPFS audio system to work seamlessly with the existing music player interface, so that I have a consistent experience regardless of the audio source.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN playing IPFS audio files THEN the player controls SHALL function identically to traditional audio files
2. WHEN switching between IPFS and traditional tracks THEN the transition SHALL be seamless
3. WHEN displaying track information THEN IPFS tracks SHALL show appropriate metadata and status indicators
4. WHEN audio loading is in progress THEN the player SHALL show appropriate loading states and progress indicators
