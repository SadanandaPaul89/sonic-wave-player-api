# Yellow SDK Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for integrating the Yellow SDK (Nitrolite) into Sonic Wave to enable hybrid NFT + subscription model with off-chain microtransactions, while also fixing the current IPFS upload and playback issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Yellow SDK Integration Foundation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate the Yellow SDK (Nitrolite) to enable off-chain microtransactions and subscription models, so that users can have instant, low-latency content access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize Nitrolite WebSocket connection
2. WHEN a user connects their wallet THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user session via WebSocket channels
3. WHEN the Nitrolite connection is established THEN the system SHALL maintain session-based balance tracking
4. IF the WebSocket connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback functionality and retry connection

### Requirement 2: Hybrid Payment Model Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to choose between subscription access and pay-per-use microtransactions, so that I can access content in the most cost-effective way for my usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses content THEN the system SHALL check subscription status first
2. IF the user has an active subscription THEN the system SHALL grant immediate access
3. IF the user has no subscription THEN the system SHALL offer pay-per-use option via microtransactions
4. WHEN a microtransaction occurs THEN the system SHALL update the off-chain state channel instantly
5. WHEN the user's balance is insufficient THEN the system SHALL prompt for payment or subscription upgrade

### Requirement 3: NFT Integration with Off-Chain State

**User Story:** As an NFT holder, I want my NFT ownership to provide exclusive access and benefits, so that my digital assets have real utility and value.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user owns an NFT THEN the system SHALL grant access to NFT-gated content
2. WHEN NFT ownership is verified THEN the system SHALL track ownership in off-chain state for instant access
3. WHEN an NFT provides exclusive benefits THEN the system SHALL apply those benefits automatically
4. IF NFT verification fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to subscription or pay-per-use options

### Requirement 4: Fixed IPFS Upload and Playback

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload local music files to IPFS and play them back seamlessly, so that I can store and access my music in a decentralized manner.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects an audio file THEN the system SHALL validate file type and size
2. WHEN a valid file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL process it and upload to IPFS successfully
3. WHEN upload completes THEN the system SHALL generate proper IPFS URLs for playback
4. WHEN a user plays an uploaded track THEN the system SHALL stream audio from IPFS without errors
5. IF upload fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options

### Requirement 5: Content Access Control System

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to define different access tiers for my content, so that I can monetize my work through various models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is created THEN the system SHALL allow setting access tiers (Free, Pay-per-use, NFT-gated, Subscription)
2. WHEN a user requests content THEN the system SHALL check appropriate access method based on content tier
3. WHEN access is granted THEN the system SHALL log the transaction in off-chain state
4. WHEN settlement occurs THEN the system SHALL batch off-chain transactions for on-chain settlement

### Requirement 6: Real-time State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want instant feedback on my transactions and access rights, so that the experience feels responsive and Web2-like.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transaction occurs THEN the system SHALL update UI state immediately
2. WHEN balance changes THEN the system SHALL reflect changes in real-time
3. WHEN subscription status changes THEN the system SHALL update access permissions instantly
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL maintain local state and sync when connection resumes
